# 🚆 Train Reservation System

This project represents my **first Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
based Python application**.

It was developed after learning: - Classes and objects - Instance
attributes - File handling - Conditional logic - Basic control flow

This project intentionally keeps the architecture simple to reflect my
early learning stage in OOP before moving toward more structured and
layered backend systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Project Objective

To simulate a basic train seat booking and cancellation system using:

-   Python classes
-   File-based persistence
-   Console-based interaction

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✨ Features

-   Two trains available:
    -   Rajdhani Express
    -   Duronto Express
-   Book seats
-   Cancel seats
-   Persistent seat storage using text files
-   Seat availability tracking
-   Fare calculation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The project follows a simple and clean structure:

-   `Train` class encapsulates all booking and cancellation logic
-   File-based storage simulates persistent seat management
-   Console interaction handles user input
-   Code and data are separated into different directories

This structure reflects foundational OOP understanding before
introducing modular architecture, logging systems, validation layers, or
APIs in later projects.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

-   Python 3
-   Text file storage
-   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ▶️ How to Run

1.  Navigate to the project folder:

    cd train-reservation-system

2.  Run the application:

    python src/train.py

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📈 Learning Reflection

This project helped me understand:

-   How classes and objects interact
-   How instance variables work
-   Basic file read/write operations
-   Control flow and input handling
-   Separation of code and data

Later projects build upon this foundation with: - Logging systems -
Exception handling - Modular structure - Repository patterns - API
integration
